# Introduction

## What is Thin Air?

Thin Air replaces the idea of tabs and folders with an infinite canvas-like interface similar to apps like Figma and Adobe Illustrator.

## What is Uix?

Uix is a library designed to generate functions to interact with your neo4j database, while maintaining the type safety we have learned to know and love thanks to TypeScript. Simply define your nodes using Zod schemas, add them to your Uix config, run the CLI, and out of thin air comes your typed functions to make database calls. 

Functions can be generated and regenerated with ease as you make changes to or add new Nodes to your schema.

Gone are the days of writing functions and api routes for every type of node and every type of change, without type safety. **Hello Uix.**
