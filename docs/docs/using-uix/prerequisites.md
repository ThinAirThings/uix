# Prerequisites

What do I need to use Uix?

## What do I need?

1. You need to have completed all of the steps in the [Getting Started](/docs/category/getting-started) section of the documentation.

2. You need to ensure that your root layout (or whichever layout you require Uix) is wrapped in the `UixProvider` generated by the CLI like such:

```tsx title="./src/app/layout.tsx"
import "./global.css";
...
import UixProvider from "../../uix/UixProvider";
...
export default function RootLayout({
    children,
}: {
    children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
    return (
        <html
            lang="en"
            >
            <body
                >
                <UixProvider>{children}</UixProvider>
            </body>
        </html>
    );
}
```

## What's next?

Now that your Uix provider is good to go and all of your functions are generated, you can start using Uix in your application.
